# 1. What is open science?

## Open Science

> Open science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about)

## The Big umbrella of Open Science

## **Discussion 1**

What are the potential benefits or challenges of making data and methods openly available? How could open science impact your future research?

# 2. FAIR principles

## What is FAIR?

[Findable -]{.smallcaps} Metadata

[Accessible -]{.smallcaps} Open data/metadata

[Interoperable -]{.smallcaps} Shared vocabularies

[Reproducible -]{.smallcaps} Rich description

## 

> "A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measurable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals."

## Metadata

Data about the data

# **3. Reproducibility in Ecological Research**

## What is reproducibility and why does it matter?

## Questionable Research Practices

[![Light columns represent the proportion of evolution researchers and dark columns represent the proportion of ecology researchers who reported having used a practice at least once. The dots show researchers' mean estimates of suspected use by colleagues in their field. Dots that are much higher than bars may suggest that the QRP is considered particularly socially unacceptable. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals.](images/pone.0200303.g001.png)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200303)

## P-hacking

> data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# Sean Trott
# Code to demonstrate p-hacking

library(tidyverse)

# set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Parameters
X_MEAN = sample(1:1000, 1)
X_SD = sample(1:10, 1)
Y_MEAN = sample(1:1000, 1)
Y_SD = sample(1:10, 1)
SUBGROUP_SIZE = 50
NUM_HACKS = 1000

# Generate data
x = rnorm(1000, mean=X_MEAN, sd=X_SD)
y = rnorm(1000, mean=Y_MEAN, sd=Y_SD)


test_coef = c()
test_p = c()
size_v = c()
for (i in c(1:NUM_HACKS)) {
  new_x = sample(x, SUBGROUP_SIZE)

## Many analysts - **Researcher degrees of freedom**

![](images/fig-forest-plots-Zr-1.png)

## Tools for reproducibility

-   Version control (e.g., Git & GitHub)
-   Coding practices, sharing scripts and protocols.
-   Preregistration
-   Registered reports

## **Discussion 2**

-   Search for a paper in your field (one that is based on data/code).
-   Do you think you can reproduce the paper?
-   What barriers are there to reproducing it?

```         
```

## Why produce open tools and code?

## Common misconceptions about open software and code

![](images/02_open_research_software_open_source.png)

## 

[Barnes (2010)](https://www.nature.com/articles/467753a)

*My code is not good enough* "if your code is good enough to do the job, then it is good enough to release ...and releasing it will help your research and your field"

*People will demand support and bug fixes*. "Publishing code may see you accused of sloppiness. Not publishing can draw allegations of fraud. Which is worse? Nobody is entitled to demand technical support for freely provided code..."

*It is too much work*. "For scientists, the word publication is totemic, and signifies perfectionism. But...the original code can be published as supplementary information, available from an institutional or journal website."

## Code and tools without a license are **not open**

# 4. **Sharable Science: Data Sharing & Collaboration**  

## Data repositories (e.g., Dryad, GBIF, LivingNorway)

## Discussion 3

How comfortable are you with sharing your data? What challenges or ethical dilemmas might you face in doing so?

# 5. **Hands-on Example: Open and Reproducible Workflow** 

# Quarto/RMarkdown

## **Discussion 4**

What part of this process seems most challenging? How could you implement something similar in your own research?
